# Dyed Books
Small Minecraft mod that allows you to dye books like you can with leather armor.

The title and description says it all! You can dye books by combining a book and dyes together.

The mod does not 'add' new items - it simply adjusts the book item itself. Because of this, if the world is loaded without the mod present, these books *should* not disappear since the book still exists in the game. (I have yet to test this). If you have a modded world that you continously upgrade along with new of Minecraft, this is a great addition. You won't lose your books on an upgrade if you forget to load this mod.

## How does this work?
This is actually not too complicated - in fact, it was very fun to learn. I'll create a wiki page on the GitHub repo to explain how this works. But in short, the mod gives books the same ability to hold special data to contain the 'dyed color' that the game uses to tint the item texture.
